Description
===========

Minimal package manager inspired by the ``pkgmgr`` of [Canopsis][1] pkgmgr but rewritten in Python (from bash).  
Development is heavly oriented for Canopsis in a first time, but it will be more generic in a second.

For information:
```
Canopsis is a hypervisor, built on top of all open source monitoring solutions
to agregate, correlate and ponderate events flowing from them.
```
